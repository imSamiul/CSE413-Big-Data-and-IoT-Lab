    "**Example: Predicting House Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're trying to predict the price of houses based on their size (in square feet). You gather a dataset with information about various houses, including their sizes and sale prices. You want to build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Feature (X)**: House Size (in square feet)\n",
    "- **Target Variable (y)**: House Price\n",
    "\n",
    "Your linear regression model might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "y = mx + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **y**: Predicted house price\n",
    "- **x**: House size\n",
    "- **m**: Coefficient (slope) representing how much the price changes for each square foot increase in size\n",
    "- **b**: Intercept, the base price when the house size is 0 (which doesn't make practical sense in this context)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your linear regression model finds the following coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coefficient (m): $150 (This means that, on average, the price of a house increases by $150 for every additional square foot in size.)\n",
    "- Intercept (b): $50,000 (This is the predicted price when the size is 0, which doesn't make sense in this context.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have a house that is 1,000 square feet in size:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Predicted Price = 150 * 1000 + 50000 = $165,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the coefficient (150) tells you that for every square foot increase in size, the price of the house is expected to increase by $150. The intercept (50000) gives you a base price, but since a house with a size of 0 square feet doesn't exist, this value doesn't hold real-world significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This coefficient provides insight into the relationship between the input feature (house size) and the target variable (house price) in the context of your linear regression model. It quantifies how changes in the input feature affect the predicted outcome.\n"
