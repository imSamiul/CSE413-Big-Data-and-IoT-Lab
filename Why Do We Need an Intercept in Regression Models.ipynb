    "Let’s understand the intuition behind the role of an intercept in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat for this article is that you are familiar with the simple equation of a straight line y = mx + c.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to understand how it plays a role in regression problems, the familiarity with regression models such as linear regression is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there are way too many articles to help us understand what regression models are and how linear regression’s been traditionally popular. However, if you want to understand the same at a granular level, there are very few. Furthermore, there’s no one stop place to understand what’s the role of an intercept in linear regression. Which is exactly my why for writing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I will start off with explaining how it plays a role geometrically and then move on to develop the intuition behind the role of an intercept. I will conclude by giving a few examples after which you will be able to tell if intercept is required or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let’s dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the equation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y = 3x. (A line with no intercept)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above equation, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 0 then y =0;\n",
    "\n",
    "x=1 then y=3;\n",
    "\n",
    "x=2 then y =6;\n",
    "\n",
    "x=3 then y = 9 and so on…\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s plot the above co-ordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key observation from the figure above is that the line passes through origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have the intercept, the line will ALWAYS pass through the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what happens if the line always pass through origin??\n",
    "\n",
    "If I ask you to join point A and B in the figure below, you can simply draw a straight line that can pass through them. ( On one condition — This line should pass through the origin)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, what If I ask you to draw a line that can pass through C and D in the figure below? ( Same condition — the line should pass through the origin)\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no possibility. But, if you do not place that extra condition, then you can simply draw as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what did just happen here? If we put an extra condition that the line should pass through the origin, there are certain situations where we won’t be able to draw a line to join two points. But, if we remove that condition, we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "That condition is nothing but the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can pass through origin — A line without intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot pass through origin — A line with intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an intercept gives our model the freedom to capture ALL the linear patterns while a model with no intercept can capture only those patterns that pass through origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, that’s great! Now we understood how intercept plays a role in capturing the patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we interpret it? What can we infer from the linear model equation that the intercept value is 0.745 or 0.2 or -0.34 etc?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we always need to have an intercept?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let’s understand the above two with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example — 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you are working for any ed-tech startup. Since there is a lot of marketing campaign going on right now, you want to predict the number of course enrollment based on the marketing campaign. So the dependent variable is course_enrollment and the independent variable is marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation here is,\n",
    "\n",
    "course_enrollment = (slope \\* marketing) + intercept. [of the form y=mx+c ]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the intercept = 0,\n",
    "\n",
    "Y = (slope\\*marketing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if the marketing campaign was stopped i.e marketing = 0, will the course enrollment be totally 0? Nope, there will definitely be a minimum number of enrollments. This, in other words indicate the trend. What will be my sales if I stop marketing right now? This question can be answered only if we use intercept. Hence, we definitely need to have intercept in this case. Now you know what it means for an intercept with a value 0.745. For this example, the intercept value of 0.745 indicate the trend when all other variables are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example — 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second example consider you are predicting the number of people who are cured from the coronavirus based on their age. Hence, the equation will be -\n",
    "\n",
    "Cured = (Slope\\*age) + intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example we went ahead with the condition that intercept = 0 and then proved that it cannot be 0. Here we do vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is, the intercept is not equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, what if the input to the equation is such that the age = 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since age = 0 and intercept is not equal to 0, it does not make sense that with age 0, number of people cured is a non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we do not require intercept in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how crucial is the role of an intercept! I hope you got a better idea of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note — If and only if you are confident that the output should be zero if all of the input variables are 0, only then can you get rid of using an intercept. Ideally, it’s preferable to always and always use an intercept in the regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, feel free to add in any points I might have missed. Happy Learning!\n"
